# Raspberry-Pi
Raspberry Pi libraries and examples for Neosegment LED modules.

## Examples

- `bitcoin-ticker.py` is a simple example of Raspberry Pi Zero driving 4 Neosegment modules to display Bitcoin ticker price in real time.

To use the included examples make sure you have this library installed (along with its Python wrapper): https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x 

## Libraries in the wild
Thanks to the community support, you can already use Neosegment on a Raspberry Pi by using one of the three various libraries: 
- [BiblioPixel library](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixelNeoSegment)
- [Luma.LED_Matrix](https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.led_matrix/pull/112)
- rpi_ws281x library with an additional class that will be published to this repo soon
