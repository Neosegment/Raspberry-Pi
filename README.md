Raspberry Pi libraries and examples for Neosegment LED modules.

## Libraries in the wild
Thanks to the community support, you can already use Neosegment on a Raspberry Pi by using one of the three various libraries: 
- [BiblioPixel library](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixelNeoSegment)
- [Luma.LED_Matrix](https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.led_matrix/pull/112)
- rpi_ws281x library with an additional class that will be published to this repo soon
